	\maketitle\bigskip
	
	Let's assume that you have learnt all the theorems and lemmas needed for chasing angles. All of these problems can be solved using angle chasing alone (ya literally), but you are free to solve them as you like. But it is highly encouraged that you try them with angle chasing first, as it will toughen up your angle chasing skills :D 
	
	\bigskip\section{\textbf{Required Theorems}}
	
	You are really gonna need at least these theorems to continue:
	
	\theorem{ The sum of the three angles of a triangle equals to $ 180^{\circ} $}
	
	\theorem{ In a triangle $ ABC $ with cicrcumcenter $ O $, we have $ \angle BOC=2\times \angle BAC $}
	
	\theorem{Let $ ABC $ be a triangle inscribed in a circle $ \omega $. Show that $ AC \perp CB $ if and only if $ AB $ is a diameter of $ \omega $.}
	
	\theorem{Let $ O $ and $ H $ denote the circumcenter and orthocenter of an acute $ \triangle ABC $, respectively. Show that $ \angle BAH = \angle CAO $. }
	
	\theorem{Let $ ABCD $ be a convex cyclic quadrilateral. Then $ \angle ABC + \angle CDA =
		180^{\circ} $ and $ \angle ABD = \angle ACD $}
	
	\theorem{Let $ ABCD $ be a convex quadrilateral. Then the
		following are equivalent:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item  $ ABCD $ is cyclic.
			\item  $ \angle ABC + \angle CDA = 180^{\circ} $.
			\item  $ \angle ABD = \angle ACD $.
	\end{enumerate}}
	
	\theorem{Suppose $ \triangle ABC $ is inscribed in a circle with
		center $ O $. Let $ P $ be a point in the plane. Then the following are equivalent:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item  $ PA $ is tangent to $ (ABC) $.
			\item  $ OA \perp AP $ .
			\item  $ \angle PAB = \angle ACB $.
	\end{enumerate}}
