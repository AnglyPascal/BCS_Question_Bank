\begin{problem_0}%[Romania TST 2013]
	Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are two distinct positive real numbers such that $\lfloor na\rfloor$ divides $\lfloor nb\rfloor$ for any positive integer $n$. Prove that $a$ and $b$ are positive integers.
\end{problem_0}

\begin{problem_0}%[2014 Iran TST P3]
	We call a $n*n$ table \emph{selfish} if we number the row and column with $0,1,2,3, \dots n-1$ (from left to right an from up to down), and for every $i,j\in\{0,1,2,...,n-1\}$ the value of cell $(i,j)$ is equal to the number of $i$ in row $j$.
	
	For example we have a \emph{selfish} table for $n=5$:
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
			1 & 0 & 3 & 3 & 4 \\
			1 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 1 \\
			0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
			2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
			1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	Prove that for $n>5$ there is no \emph{selfish} table.
\end{problem_0}

\begin{problem_0}%[ARO 2016 11.5]
	Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $k_0,k_1, \dots,k_{2n}$ be nonzero integers such that $k_0+k_1 +\dots+k_{2n}\neq 0$. Is it always possible to find a permutation $(a_0,a_1,\dots,a_{2n})$ of $(k_0,k_1,\dots,k_{2n})$ so that the equation
	\[a_{2n}x^{2n}+a_{2n-1}x^{2n-1}+\dots+a_0=0\]
	has no integer roots?
\end{problem_0}

\begin{problem_0}%[ISL 1998 C4]
	Let $U=\{1,2,\ldots ,n\}$, where $n\geq 3$. A subset $S$ of $U$ is said to be split by a permutation of the elements of $U$ if an element not in $S$ occurs in the permutation somewhere between two elements of $S$. 
	
	For example, $ 13542 $ splits $\{1,2,3\}$ and $ \{1, 5\} $ but not $\{3,4,5\}$. 
	
	Prove that for any $n-2$ subsets of $U$, each containing at least 2 and at most $n-1$ elements, there is an permutation of the elements of $U$ which splits all of them.
