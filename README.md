# Journal of Math Olympiad Problems
A journal of theorems, lemmas and problems for Mathematical Olympiads. 

At the moment of compiling, this journal has 682 randomly ordered problems, 210 theorems
and lemmas, and 174 figures, mostly geometric, drawn in geogebra and inkscape.

This journal is divided into chapter/section/subsection manner. Each subsection starts
with a list of useful theorems of lemmas related to that topic, followed by problems and
solutions or hints. At the end of the journal, there are four indices: Problems, Theorems,
Definitios and Strategies, that alphabetically list all the items in here. You can use
them to quickly search for a problem or a theorem in this journal.

I intended this journal to be just a list of tricks when I began working on it. Over the
years, this file has grown in size and has become massive. Instead of using it as a book,
it is advised to use it as an extra large problem set and a resources file.

To compile you need to have Computer Modern, Share and Titillium fonts, and the sty files
can be found at https://github.com/AnglyPascal/dotfiles/sty
