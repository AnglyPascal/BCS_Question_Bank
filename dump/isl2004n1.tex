if $p\not|n$, $\tau(pn)=\tau(p)\tau(n)= 2\tau(n)=n$ which is true for $n$

let's try $p^k$, and $p^t||n$,
\[\tau(p^{k+t}m)=(k+t+1)\tau(m)=p^tm\]

for $k+1 < p$, if $t=0$, we don't really have an obvious contradiction. 

So what if $k+1=p$, then, $t=0, 1$

if $t=0$, $\ p\tau(m)=m$ but $(p, m)=1$

and if $t=1$, \[(p+1)\tau(m)=pm\] but trivial bounding shows that $m<=4$, for which there is no solution by case check
