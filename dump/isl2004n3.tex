First get $ f(1)=1 $, then using casework, get $ f(p-1)=p-1 $. Then let $ m=(p-1) $, and use the division algorithm to reduce the dividend.

\begin{Remark}
	In nt-fe s with ``divisible" condition, one occurring idea is to get an infinite set of integers with the desired output value, and somehow keep those numbers only in the divisor, and make them vanish from the dividend. Most of the time, using division algorithm to reduce the dividend does the trick.
