{Thue's Note}{}{
    Let $S$ be a set of all positive integers which can be represented as
    $a^2+ 5b^2$ for some coprime integers $a,b$. Let $p$ be a prime number
    such that $p= 4n+ 3$ for some integer $n$. Show that if for some positive
    integer $k$ the numberk $p$ is in $S$, then $2p$ is in $S$ as well.
