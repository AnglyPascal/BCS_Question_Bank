    Let $p$ be prime number, prove that there exists $x, y$ such that
    $p=2x^2+3y^3$ iff $p\equiv 5, 11 \ (\mod\ 24)$.

{Thue's Note}{}{
    Let $S$ be a set of all positive integers which can be represented as
    $a^2+ 5b^2$ for some coprime integers $a,b$. Let $p$ be a prime number
    such that $p= 4n+ 3$ for some integer $n$. Show that if for some positive
    integer $k$ the numberk $p$ is in $S$, then $2p$ is in $S$ as well.
