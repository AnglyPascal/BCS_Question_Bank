		\solu{Playig around with some primes give us that for every ``big'' primes, we need to have every residue class present in the range of $ g $. Now with this fact, we can prove the injectivity as well. Now we want to show that $ g(n+1)=g(n)+1 $. How to show that? We can show that by saying that no prime $ p $ exits such that $ p|g(n+1)-g(n) $, in other words, again the residue classes.}
