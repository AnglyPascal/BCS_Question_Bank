\den{Skeleton Diagram}{
    In a triangle $ABC$, $M$ is the center of $BC$. $B', C'$ are on $\odot
    ABC$ such that $BB'\parallel CC' \parallel AM$. Let $R$ be the point on
    $BC$ such that $\odot B'C'R$ is tangent to $BC$. Draw the two circles
    through $BB'$ and $CC'$ that are tangent to $BC$. Also let $S = BC \cap
    B'C'$, and let $G$ be such that $SG$ is tangent to $\odot ABC$ at $G$.
    Also let $ M_a, M_A $ be the minor and major arc midpoints of $ \widehat{BC} $.

    Now let $ M_AR\cap AM = H, M_AR\cap\odot ABC = G $.

        Let $ I $ be the intersection of the line through $ M_a $
            parallel to $ AM $ and $ \omega_x $.
        Let $ J=AM\cap\omega_x $.
        Let $ J\cap\omega_b=X, J\cap\omega_c=Y $.
