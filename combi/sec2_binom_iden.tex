			\solu{First, the combi solution: Look at the right side, try to translate it to combinatorial model. If we had used the inclusion-exclusion method, the right side would be the number of ways to color a row of length $ m $ with $ n $ colors, with each color appearing at least once. Now our remaining job is to prove the same for the left side.}
			
			
			\solu{Now, the algebraic, GF solution: Now that we have made up our mind that we are going to use GF, let's try to apply GF to the more innocent looking term on the left side. We quickly get a polynomial for that. Now the right side, alternating sums of binomials, gives an experienced psolver the idea of finite differences. If we think of the polynomial as the $ n $'th finite difference of a polynomial, we need the original polynomial to be a 2D poly. from here the idea follows and we get a nice polynomial for the right side. But how do we show that the two polynomials on the two sides are equal? We need to get a closed form for the right side poly. But to get this, we think inductively.}
