		\begin{enumerate}
			\item We choose a partition $ \{1,\dots,n\} = I\cup J$, where $ I$ and $ J$ are two disjoint sets, such that the expression \[ \left|\sum_{i\in I}x_i - \sum_{j\in J}x_j\right| \] attains the smallest value. (We allow $ I$ or $ J$ to be empty; in this case the corresponding sum is 0.) If there are several such partitions, one is chosen arbitrarily.
			\item We set $ A_{k + 1} = (y_1,\dots,y_n)$ where $ y_i = x_i + 1$ if $ i\in I$, and $ y_i = x_i - 1$ if $ i\in J$.

			\solu{Suppose the contrary. Now, since $ A_i $ can only attain finite values, So $ A_i = A_j $ for some $ i, j $. Now, we are taking about changes here, so we need to think of some invariants. Firstly the sum, it's not much of an help, because it doesn't give us much control. So kinda sum-ish invariant with a bit more control is the sum of squares. We combine these two ideas.}

Prove that the sequence $ s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots$ is itself an arithmetic progression.}
		
			\solu{First notice that the two arithmetic sequences has the same common difference. Then notice that the diffrences of the original sequence is bounded. Another advice, give everything names. After naming the smallest difference and the largest differnce, we get two different inequalities, from where we deduce that the difference is constant.}
