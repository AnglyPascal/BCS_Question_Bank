    \den{Cut}{
        A cut is a partition of the vertices of a graph into two disjoint subsets.
        Any cut determines a cut-set, the set of edges that have one endpoint in
        each subset of the partition. These edges are said to cross the cut. In a
        connected graph, each cut-set determines a unique cut, and in some cases
        cuts are identified with their cut-sets rather than with their vertex
        partitions.

\begin{solution}[dgrozev]
    First we construct a spanning tree $T$ that maximizes the number of leaves,
    then we bound the number. We define $G(V, E), n = \left|V\right| $ with
    the usual notations.\\

    Let $f: V \to V$. We initialize the tree by selecting a vertex $v$ by
    random, and adding it to $T$. We inductively add the vertices according to
    the following priority checks:

    \begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\boxed{\arabic*.}}, itemsep=5pt]
        \item If there is a vertex $v\not \in T$ that is connected to $u\in T$
            such that $u$ is not a leaf, then add $v, uv$ to $T$.
        \item If $u\in T$ is a leaf and there are two $v_1, v_2$ not in $T$
            that are connected to $u$, add $v_1, v_2$ and $uv_1, uv_2$ to $T$.
        \item If $u\in T$ is a leaf, and there is a $v$ which has two
            neighbors outside of $T$, then add $v, uv$ to $T$, and let $f(u)=v$.
        \item If $u\in T$ is a leaf, there is a $v \not \in T$ which is
            connected to at most one vertex outside $T$, and connected to
            $u'\in T$, then add $v, uv$ to $T$ and let $f(u) = u'$.
    \end{enumerate}
    This algorithm will add all the vertices to the tree. We now need to bound
    the number of leaves.\\

    Let $n_1, n_2, n_3$ be the set of vertices that have $1, 2$ and more than
    $3$ neighbors respectively. Since $f$ is a injection from the set $n_2$ to
    either $n_1$ or $n_3$, we have since $n = n_1+n_2+n_3$,
    \[n_2 \le n_1 + n_3,\quad n_2 \le \frac{n}{2}\]
    Bounding the number of edges gives us:
    \[\begin{aligned}
        2n-2 &\ge n_1 + 2n_2 + 3n_3\\
             &= n_1 + 3(n-n_1) - n_2\\
             &\ge 3n - 2n_1 - \frac{n}{2}\\
        \implies n_1 &\ge \frac{n}{4}+1
    \end{aligned}\]
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[\href{http://wwwmayr.in.tum.de/konferenzen/Jass08/courses/1/gravin/Gravin_Slides.pdf}{Paper}]
    The construction is the same as before. But we define a different cost
    fuction $f$ to bound our leaves count. Let $D(T)$ be the number of leaves in
    $T$ which doesn't have a neighbor outside of $T$. Let $L(T)$ be the number of
    all leaves, and $V(T)$ is the number of vertices of $T$. Then consider 
    \[\boxed{f(T) = 3L(T) + D(T) - V(T)}\] 
    We show that $f(T)$ is non decreasing in our construction. If it is, we
    will get by setting $f(T_0)$ for a one vertex and its neighbor tree $T_0$, 
    \[f(T) \ge f(T_0) \ge 3\times 3 +0 -4 = 5 \] 
    And since $D(T') = L(T')$ for a spanning tree $T'$, \[L(T') \ge \frac{N+5}{4}\] 
    We now check that for all of your steps in construction, $f(T)$ is non
    decreasing.

Some pairs of $ i $ -mons in the lab can be entangled, and each $ i $ -mon can participate in many entanglement relations.

    \begin{enumerate}

        \item If some $ i $ -mon is entangled with an odd number of other $ i $ -mons in the lab, then the physicist can destroy it.

        \item At any moment, he may double the whole family of $ i $ -mons in the lab by creating a copy $ I' $ of each $ i $ -mon $ I $. During this procedure, the two copies $ I' $ and $ J' $ become entangled if and only if the original $ i $ -mons $ I $ and $ J $ are entangled, and each copy $ I' $ becomes entangled with its original $ i $ -mon $ I $ ; no other entanglements occur or disappear at this moment.

\solu{As there are an integer number of $ i $ -mons, it is quite natural to use induction. We try to find an algorithm to reduce the number of particles.

Another way to do this is to consider the chromatic number of the graph. If we can show that this number reduces after some move, then we are done by induction.}

\solu{Trying to apply induction, we realize the bound is very loosy. That's why when we try to add in the inductive step, the value becomes larger than the bound. To stop that overflow, we tighten the bound.}

\solu{The second and dummy approach is to first doing some smaller cases, finding small infos, taking the root, seeing that the bound doesnt work, but it would work if one of the successors of the root would have exactly or less than $ 2k+3 $ successors.

After that, we make every nodes have degree either $ \{1, -1\} $. So after this operation we remove the $ 1 $ -edges. Now, when dealing with the type- $ 2 $ sub-graph. Start over from zero, we see that when making a path between nodes $ x, y $ the degree of those two changes parity, and other nodes on the path stays the same. So select two odd nodes.... }
