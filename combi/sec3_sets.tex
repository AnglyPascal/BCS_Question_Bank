    Suppose that $ A $ is a family of distinct subsets of $\{ 1 , 2 \dots n
    \}$ such that each subset is of size $ r $ and each pair of subsets has a
    nonempty intersection, and suppose that $ n \geq 2r $. Then the number of

\lem{Kleitman lemma}{A set family $F$ is said to be downwards closed if the following holds: if $X$ is a set in $F$, then all subsets of $X$ are also sets in $F$. Similarly, $F$ is said to be upwards closed if whenever $X$ is a set in $F$, all sets containing $X$ are also sets in $F$. Let $F_1$ and $F_2$ be downwards closed families of subsets of $S = \{1, 2, ..., n\}$, and let $F_3$ be an upwards closed family of subsets of $S$. Then we have

    \begin{align}
        |F_1 \cap F_2| &\geq \frac{|F_1| \cdot |F_2|}{2^n}\\

\lem{The Sunflower Lemma}{A sunflower with $ k $ petals and a core $ X $ is a family of sets $ S_1, S_2,\dots, S_k $ such that $ S_i\cap S_j = X $ for each $ i \neq j $. (The reason for the name is that the Venn diagram representation for such a family resembles a sunflower.) The sets $ S_i \setminus X $ are known as petals and must be nonempty, though $ X $ can be empty. Show that if $ F $ is a family of sets of cardinality $ s $, and $ |F| > s!(k-1)^s $, then $ F $ contains a sunflower with $ k $ petals.}\label{problem:induction_type1_20}\label{problem:extreme_object_10}
