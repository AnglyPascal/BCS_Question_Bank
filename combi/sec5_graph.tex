		\begin{itemize}
			\item One common way to turn a grid into graphs is to create a bipartite graph between the columns and rows such that $ c_i $ and $ r_j $ are connected iff $ (i, j) $ is marked. This way we can find cycles alternating row and column.
			
			\item Creating a bipartite graph between all rows and columns and particular objects. This helps to prove matching.

			\itemsep-.3em
			\item Each player wins against at least $a$ players, and loses to at least $b$ players. ($a,b\geq 1$)

		\rem{Typical largest path, some workaround with given constraints problem.}

		\solu{Take the largest path starting from $ a_1 $ to $ a_n $. 
			\begin{solution_def}
				Assume that $ n\le a+b $. Since this is the largest path, $ a $ edges coming out of $ a_n $ are all in $ S=\{a_1, a_2, \dots a_n\} $, and $ b $ edges going in $ a_1 $ are all in $ S $. Let $ S_1 $ be the set of vertices that $ a_n $ wins against, and $ S_2 $ be the set of vertices that $ a_1 $ loses against. Moreover, let $ a_l $ be the smallest element of $ S_1 $, and $ a_{n-k} $ be the largest element of $ S_2 $ (smallest means leftmost in the part, and largest means rightmost).\\
				
				Let $ S'=\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots a_{n-k-1}, a_{n-k}\} $. Since $ n\le a+b $, we have $ S'\ne \varnothing $. \\
				
				We also define:
					\[ S_1'=\{a_i\mid a_i \text{ defeats } a_{i+1} \text{ where } a_{i+1} \in S_1\cap S' \}\]
					\[S_2'=\{a_i\mid a_{i-1} \text{ defeats } a_{i} \text{ where } a_{i-1} \in S_2\cap S'\}\]
			\end{solution_def}
			\figdf{.4}{China_TST_2015_T1_D2_P3_1}{}
		Now, note that for any $ x\in S_2' $, $ y\in S_1' $, there is a path between $ x, y $ with $ n $ vertices. So for all $ x\in S_2' $, there does not exist a vertex outside of $ S $ that defeats $ x $. And for all $ y\in S_1' $, there doesn't exist a vertex outside of $ S $ that loses to $ y $, because of the maximality of $ n $. \\
		
		We show that, $ S_1'\cap S_2' \ne \varnothing $. Then there would exist a vertex that doesn't have any edge outside of $ S $, meaning it has at least $ a+b $ games inside $ S $, proving the result.\\ 
		
		We have, $ S_1', S_2' \subset S'\cup\{a_{l-1}, a_{n-k+1}\} $. We have, 
			\begin{align*}
				|S_1'| &\ge a-k+2\quad [\because a_n \text{ has at most } k-2 \text{ vertices in } \{a_{n-k+1}, \dots a_n\}]\\
				|S_2'| &\ge b-l+3
			\end{align*}
		But $ |S'|=n-(l-1)-(k)+2 \le a+b-l-k+3 < |S_1'|+|S_2'| $. So $ S_1'\cap S_2' \ne \varnothing $, and we are done.}

Each black cell has an even (0, 2 or 4) number of adjacent (by the side) white cells. Prove that one may colour each white cell in green or red such that every black cell will have equal number of red and green adjacent cells.\index{Graph!Grid $ \to $ Graph!ARO 2005 P10.8}\index{Graph!Bipartite!ARO 2005 P10.8}}
		
		\solu{First we join the white cells like this:
			\figdf{.8}{ARO_2005_P10_8}{}
			Now, notice that the plane have been divided into some cycles (a black cell that has no adjacent black cells is a cycle itself). So we can color the plane blue and yellow in a way that no region has the same color as its neighbors. We can do this because at any junction, there are an even number of regions connected because of the problem condition.\\
			
			Now we focus on our graph that we created connected the white cells. Take any cycle on it. If we have a ``slanted'' edge, then both of the nodes are inside a region of either blue or yellow. But in a ``straight'' edge, the two nodes are in different colored region.\\
			
			We know that there are an even number of slanted edges, which is trivial to prove (using the fact that any cycle on a grid system has even number of nodes, and on these cycles, most of the edges (the straight ones) have even lenght, but only the slanted one has odd lenghts on the sides). It is also easy to see that there are an even number of straight edges, because of going in and out of the regions of a fixed color.\\
			
			So our cycle has an even number of nodes and thus bipartite. We can color the graph with two colors, so that along each edge, the two nodes are of different color.}
		
		\rem{There is a simple coloring using this solution. After we color the regions of the plane with blue and yellow, we number each column with integers. Then on the odd numbered columns, we color all the white cells that are in yellow region green and blue region red. And on the even numbered columns, we do the opposite. It is easy to check that this coloring works using the graph we created before.}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Choose a vertex $ v $ that contains one or more coins, and remove all the coins from $ v $.
			\item Then, move each coin remaining on the tree to the vertex that is nearest to $ v $	among the adjacent vertices of the coin's current vertex.

The hooligans Vasya and Petya cut the wires one after another. Vasya, who starts, cuts one wire on his turn, while Petya cuts one or three. The hooligan who cuts the last wire from some component loses. Who has the winning strategy?\index{Algorithm!Copycat!ARO 1999 P9.8}}
	
		\solu{[Copycat]
		The P-Hooligan Petya has a winning strategy, for he can be follow the old cunning trick of never losing. How does he do it?
			
		He starts by secretly partitioning the vertices in two $ 1000 $ degree subsets. He calls them $ A= \{a_1, a_2\dots a_{1000}\} $ and $ B=\{b_1, b_2 \dots b_{1000}\} $. He then connects $ a_i $ with $ b_i $ with an edge with an invisible marker that only he can see. 
		
		Now the game begins. Petya copies Vasyas moves following these rules:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\itemsep.5em
				\item If Vasya removes an edge $ a_i$ -- $a_j $, where $ i\ne j $, then Patya removes the edges $ a_i$ -- $b_j,\ a_j$ -- $b_i$ and $ b_i$ -- $b_j $.
				\item If Vasya removes $a_j$ -- $b_i$, where $ i\ne j $, then Patya removes the other three edges from the above rule.
				\item If Vasya removes $ a_i $--$ b_i $, then Patya looks for another $ b_j $, such that $ a_i $--$ b_j $ exists. Then by the symmetry so far maintanined, $ a_j $--$ b_i $ and $ a_j $--$ b_j $ exist too. And Patya can remove $ a_j$--$ b_j $, and swap the names of $ b_j $ and $ b_i $. 
				
				But if he can't, then that would mean after Vasya's move $ a_i $ would become isolated, and Patya would win. 
			\end{enumerate}
		It is easy to see that the above moves are possible since Patya is always maintaining symmetry between $ A, B $. So he can't move means Vasya has already disconnected one of the vertices.}
