{Sperner's Lemma}{
    Given a triangle $ABC$, and a triangulation $\mathcal{T}$ of the triangle,
    the set $S$ of vertices of $\mathcal{T}$ is colored with three colors in
    such a way that
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $A, B$, and $C$ are colored $1, 2$, and $3$ respectively.
        \item Each vertex on an edge of $ABC$ is to be colored only with one of the
            two colors of the ends of its edge. For example, each vertex on $AC$
            must have a color either $1$ or $3$.
    \end{enumerate}
    Then there exists a triangle from $\mathcal{T}$, whose vertices are colored with the
    three different colors. More precisely, there must be an odd number of
    such triangles. 
}


\begin{prooof}
    Consider a graph $G$ built from the triangulation $\mathcal{T}$ as
    follows:\\

    {\color{solC}The vertices of $G$ are the members of $\mathcal{T}$ plus the
    area outside the triangle.  Two vertices are connected with an edge if
    their corresponding areas share a common border with an edge $1$--$2$.\\}

    Note that on the interval $AB$ there is an odd number of borders colored
    $1$--$2$. Therefore, the vertex of $G$ corresponding to the outer area has
    an odd degree. \\

    But since in a finite graph there is an even number of
    vertices with odd degree, in the remaining graph, excluding the
    outer area, there is {\color{solC}an odd number of vertices with odd
    degree} corresponding to members of $\mathcal{T}$.\\

    It can be easily seen that the only possible degree of a triangle from
    $\mathcal{T}$ is $0, 1$, or $2$, and that the degree $1$ corresponds to a
    triangle colored with the three colors $1, 2$, and $3$.\\

    Thus we have obtained a slightly stronger conclusion, which says that in a
    triangulation $\mathcal{T}$ there is an odd number (and at least one) of
    full-colored triangles.

\solu{The condition that tells us to go either right or left, seems very non-rigorous. So to rigorize this condition, instead of using right or left condition in the direction, we consider whatâ€™s on our right and left. (INTUITION) After some experiment we see (not all of us) that if we color the plane with two colors in a way where every neighboring regions have different colors, we find some interesting stuff.

\solu{The straight way, induction.}

\solu{The intuitive way, bijection. There are at most $ n $ good triangles, there are $ 2n $ edges, so a mapping that takes a two edges to a single good triangle must exist. Finding it is not that hard.}

Among these diagonals, a diagonal is called good if it intersects exactly one other diagonal drawn (in the interior of the $ n $ -gon).

\solu{There can be two cases, two good diagonals intersecting each other, and no two good diagonals intersecting each other. In the first case, we just use induction, and in the later, all of the good diagonals create a ``triangulation'' of the polygon, which gives us the numbers.}

        \item No line passes through any point of the configuration.

\solu{Obviously a n00b would think about induction. The only problem occurs when the convex hull completely consists of red points. In this case, after some investigation, we should get the sandwiching two points idea.}

\solu{Another way of inductive approach is like this, as the problem condition says that no region contains points of both colors, which means if we connect any two red and blue points, some line must bisect this segment. Now \hrf{problem:convex_hull_1}{it is known} that there is non intersecting partition of the points in to red-blue segments. So suppose in such a partition, we draw bisectors of each segments. Now there will be some holes in this proof. We see that to fill these holes, we have to focus on two red points with their respective blue partners, and draw the two bisectors in a way that separates the two red points form the blue points. So to remove further holes, we get the sandwiching idea.}

Prove that the number of good circles has the same parity as $n$.}


\solu{When thinking about induction, got a feeling that double counting with the number of good circles going through pairs of points might be useful, because a good circle will be counted three times, if we can show that every pair has odd number of good circles, we are done. So, take a pair. Now we need to `sort' the points somehow. See that, we can't sort the points in a trivial way with numbers, so moving to angles. Now setting conditions for a point inside of a circle in terms of angles, we see amazing patter, and an easy way to calculate the number of good circle of that pair of points.}
