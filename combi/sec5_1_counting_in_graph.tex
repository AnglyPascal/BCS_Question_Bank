    {Turan's theorem}{
        Let $ G $ be any graph with $ n $ vertices, such that $ G $ is $ K_{r+1} $
        -free. Then $ G $ is the ``Turán's Graph'' and is a complete $ r $ partite
        graph. And the number of edges in $ G $ is at most 

        \[\frac {r-1}{r}\cdot \frac {n^{2}}{2}=\left(1-\frac {1}{r}\right)\cdot
        \frac {n^{2}}{2}\]

        A special case of Turán's theorem for $ n=2 $ is the \textbf{Mantel's
        Theorem}. It states that the maximal triangle free graph is a complete
        bipartite graph with at most $ \left\lfloor\dfrac{n^2}{4}\right\rfloor $
        edges.

\proof{We need to prove that the maximal graph is the $ r $ partite one, and the rest will follow. We can directly try to prove that this graph is $ r $ colorable, but that is quite troublesome. Instead, we try to show that, we can partition the vertices of $ G $ into equivalence classes based on their non-neighbors. Since this is imply the former. So we need to prove that \hrf{lemma:criteria_of_partition_equiv}{this} holds for this graph.\\ 

The way it is done is quite interesting. We need to show that if the criteria doesn't hold in this graph, then this graph is not the maximal graph. How are we going to do that? We compare the degrees of $ u, w $, and replace either $ u $ by $ w $ or $ w $ by $ u $ to get a graph with more edges and without the nasty situation.}

A swell coloring of $ K_n $ is an assignment of a color to each of the edges such that the edges of any triangle are either all of distinct colors or all the same color.

\solu{A starting idea to get the ans: if we discard of all the $ 2 $-edges, we see that in any triangle, one edge has to be a $ 3 $-edge. So... Turan-kinda...}

\solu{After getting the ans, and thinking about approaching inductively, if we remove only one vertex, there will be pairs to consider. But if we remove two vertices, we will only need to consider single vertices after the removal of these two vertices.\\

    Now which pair of vertices are the best choice to remove? Before doing that, lets first think how much change will we get in the sum after we remove two vertices. Since we have the ans, we do quick maffs: 
    \[m(4m+1) - (m-1)(4m-3) = 8m -3 = 4\times (2m-1) + 1\]

Doesn't this indicate that we remove a $ 1 $-edge, so the other edges coming out of the two vertices will sum up to be at least $ 4*(2m-1) $.}


\solu{The solution by bern is very pretty. What he probably had thought was:\\

    If we pick a vertex, say $ u $, and take an $ 1 $-edge from this vertex to another vertex $ v $, we see that there are at least as many $ 3 $-edges in $ u $ than there are $ 1 $-edges in $ v $. Now if to get a more accurate value of $ d_3(u) $ (defined naturally), we need to take the maximum of the values $ d_1(v) $ for all $ v $'s connected to $ u $. \\

    Now we need to evaluate the number of $ 3 $ edges from the $ d_1 $ values. Can we put a bound on this sum? We have \hrf{lemma:graph_lemma_1}{\textbf{this lemma}}, does this help? Turns out that it does.\\

What left is to sum it all up to see if we can get the ans.}

\solu{Windmills won't be there if among any $ 2n+1 $ vertices, there were one vertex that were not connected to any of the other $ 2n $ vertices.
