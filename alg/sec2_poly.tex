		\begin{take_note*}{}
			\begin{enumerate}[wide=0em, label=\arabic*, itemsep=10pt, parsep=5pt, font=\bfseries]
				\item A polynomial with odd degree always has at least one real root.
				\item If a polynomial with even degree has a negative value on its graph, then it has at least one real root.
				\item Roots of unity divide a polynomial in parts like congruence classes.
				\item MODULUS SIGN: use Triangle Inequality.
				\item They say, In Poly, chase ROOTS.
				\item $ x^nf(\dfrac{1}{x}) $ has the same coefficients as $ f(x) $, but in opposite order.
			\end{enumerate}
		\end{take_note*}
	
	
	
		\theo{}{Lagrange Interpolation Theorem}{Given $n$ real numbers, there exist a polynomial with at most $n-1$ degree such that the graph of the polynomial goes through all of the points.}
			
		\theo{}{Finite Differences}{This is the descrete form of derivatives. The first finite difference of a function $ f $ is defined as $ g(x) := f(x+1)-f(x) $.
		
		$ n+1 $th finite difference of a $ n $ degree polynomial: For any polynomial $P(x)$ of degree at most $n$ the following equation holds: \[\sum_{i=0}^{n+1}(-1)^i \binom{n+1}{i}P(i)=0\]}\label{finite_difference}
		
		\begin{Remark}
			This can be used 
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item to reduce the degree of a polynomial, manipulate the coefficients etc.
				\item to solve recurrences, where the recurrence equation is a bit messy and contains a lot of previous values. Like this recurrence is quite messy to solve as it is, but if we take the first finite difference here, it becomes easy:\[f(x) = \frac{1}{3} f(x+1) + \frac{2}{3} f(x-1) + 1\]
				
				It's like solving for the first derivative and then finding the original function.

	\prob{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h587303p3476290}{USA TST 2014 P4}{E}{Let $n$ be a positive even integer, and let $c_1, c_2, \dots, c_{n-1}$ be real numbers satisfying \[ \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \left\lvert c_i-1 \right\rvert < 1. \] Prove that \[2x^n - c_{n-1}x^{n-1} + c_{n-2}x^{n-2} - \dots - c_1x^1 + 2\] has no real roots.}
	
		\solu{A polynomial has no real root means that the polynomial completely lies in either of the two sides of the $x$-axis. So in this case, we have to prove that $P(x)>0$. So we gotta try to bound. Again, to make $\vert c_i-1 \vert$ a little bit more approachable, we assign $b_i=c_i-1$ and write $P(x)$ in terms of $b_i$. Now, how to bring the modulus sign in our polynomial? Oh, we have triangle ineq for those kinda work :0}

If the resulting polynomial has no real roots, $ A$ wins. Otherwise, $ B$ wins. If $ A$ begins, which player has a winning strategy?}
	
		\solu{Not always (actually in very few cases) the first move decides the winning strategy. In this case, if $B$ could make the last move, he would definitely win. But as he can't, consider the final two moves. Again ``Waves''.}

	\solu{The degree is $2n$, and we have to find a zero, so proving/disproving the existence of negative value of $P(x)$ is enough. If all the values of $P(x)$ are to be positive, the leading coefficient must be very big...}
